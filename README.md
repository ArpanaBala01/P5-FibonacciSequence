# P5-FibonacciSequence
<h3>Write A Program To Print The Fibonacci Sequence For Requiered Quantity.<br></h3>

<strong><i>Fibonacci Sequence</i></strong>:<p style="font-size:79px"> In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The sequence starts: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....
<br>The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:
<ul>
<li>the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)</li>
<li>the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2)</li>
<li>the 5 is (2+3), and so on!</li>
</ul>

Input:

```Python
Enter number of elements required : 4
```

Output:

```Python
Fibonacci Sequence for 4 elements is : 0, 1, 1, 2
```
